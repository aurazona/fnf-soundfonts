# SUBMITTING
got a couple soundfonts you wanna deposit here?
a couple guidelines:

ideally, soundfonts should be made from their source/official chromatics. otherwise...

NO UTAUS: unless the actual voice is an utau, i.e garcello, don't submit soundfonts made from utaus. they sound like ass, dawg.
MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN TUNE: throwin in some shitty outta tune soundfont is right out. like deadass dawg, nobody's gonna be usin that shit.
MAKE SURE THEY'RE OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY: takin one sample, shittin it out all over a piano roll, and makin that a soundfont ain't gonna fly.

still not sure your soundfont's up to scratch? take a look at the EXAMPLES folder. if you think your soundfont falls into the BAD category, don't submit it.
